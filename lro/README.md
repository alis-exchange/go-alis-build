# Long-Running Operations (LROs)

## Background

Long-running operations (LROs) are a pattern in resource-driven design where an operation takes an extended period of 
time to complete. This can be due to a number of factors, such as the size of the operation, the amount of data 
involved, or the availability of resources.

LROs are often used for tasks such as:
- Copying large amounts of data 
- Processing large amounts of data 
- Running complex queries 
- Executing long-running tasks

LROs can be implemented in a number of ways, but the most common approach is to use a client-server model. 
In this model, the client initiates the operation and the server performs the operation in the background. 
The client can then poll the server to check the status of the operation until it is complete.

## This package

This package makes managing LROs on your server super simple. ðŸ˜Ž

Practically, this package provides a client for managing long-running operations (LROs) using Google Cloud Bigtable.  
The `go.alis.build/lro` package provides a number of features for managing LROs, including:
- Creating LROs: The CreateOperation method creates a new LRO and stores it in Bigtable.
- Getting LROs: The GetOperation method gets an LRO from Bigtable.
- Updating LROs: The SetSuccessful and SetFailed methods update the status of an LRO in Bigtable.
