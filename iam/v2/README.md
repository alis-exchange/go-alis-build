# IAM: A Simple Identity and Access Management Package for use on the Alis Build Platform.

This package provides a straightforward way to manage identity and access control in your Go applications running on the Alis Build Platform, inspired by the Google IAM Policy framework. 

## Features

* **Authentication and Authorization:** Handles both identification (authn) and authorization (authz).
* **Flexible Access Control:** Determine if a **Principal** (user or service account) can perform a specific **Permission** (e.g., Get, Update, List) on a designated **Resource**.
* **Resource-Oriented Design:** Aligns with Resource-Driven Development (RDD) principles as outlined in [RDD](https://google.com) and [API Improvement Proposals](https://aip.dev).

## Getting Started
