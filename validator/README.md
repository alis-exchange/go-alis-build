# Alis Build Platform - Validation

You're developing a Golang package to streamline and centralize the validation of incoming API requests.
This package will ensure data integrity by enforcing rules about data formats, required fields, and other
constraints. It aims to improve API security, provide better user experience through informative error
messages, and enhance overall code maintainability by offering a structured approach to validation logic.
