# Alis Build packages for Go
This repository contains useful packages for Alis Builders building on the Alis Build platform.

The Alis Build platform enables individuals and teams to build their own digital innovations.

## The Alis Build Platform

Developing high-quality software requires meeting several demanding requirements such as scalability, accessibility, 
security, usability, and interoperability with other digital services. However, these requirements entail significant 
costs and expertise, particularly at a larger scale, which can create daunting barriers to entry for both individuals 
and organizations.

While there are existing technologies and standards that could reduce these barriers, they are currently disjointed 
and require considerable effort to consolidate and effectively leverage before their benefits can be realized.
To address this issue, we have carefully analyzed these complex problems and identified the best open-source 
technologies and standards. By integrating these resources, we aim to make it easier for users to build innovative 
solutions by following three simple steps: define, build, and deploy.

Our aim is to make it accessible for you to build your own innovation by following the three easy steps: define, 
build and deploy.
